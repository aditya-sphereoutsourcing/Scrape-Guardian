3. Vulnerability Scanning (Basic Checks)
Objective: Identify common vulnerabilities such as outdated components or misconfigurations.
Method:

Write functions that simulate common attack patterns (e.g., sending SQL injection or XSS payloads to input fields).
Optionally, run system commands (via subprocess) to execute local vulnerability scanners (if installed).
Note: For in‑depth scanning, tools like OWASP ZAP or Nikto are ideal. You can call them from Python if you have them installed, but here we outline simple payload-based checks.

4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Testing
Objective: Check if input fields or URL parameters are vulnerable to XSS.
Method:

Define a set of XSS payloads.
Use requests or Selenium to submit these payloads to forms/endpoints and check the reflected output.
Pseudo‑Code:

python
Copy
Edit
def test_xss(url, payload="<script>alert('XSS')</script>"):
    # This is a simplified example. In reality, you'll need to know form parameters.
    params = {"search": payload}
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    if payload in response.text:
        return "Potential XSS vulnerability detected!"
    else:
        return "No XSS vulnerability found."

# Example usage:
print(test_xss("https://example.com/search"))
5. SQL Injection Testing
Objective: Test forms, URL parameters, and API endpoints for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
Method:

Send typical SQL injection payloads (e.g., ' OR '1'='1 or '; DROP TABLE users; --)
Analyze the response for errors or unusual behavior.
Pseudo‑Code:

python
Copy
Edit
def test_sql_injection(url, param="id"):
    payload = "' OR '1'='1"
    params = {param: payload}
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    if "SQL" in response.text or "syntax error" in response.text.lower():
        return "Potential SQL injection vulnerability detected!"
    else:
        return "SQL injection test passed."

# Example usage:
print(test_sql_injection("https://example.com/item"))
6. Authentication & Session Management Testing
Objective: Ensure that authentication mechanisms are secure and session cookies are properly flagged.
Method:

Simulate login attempts with requests.Session(), then inspect cookies for HttpOnly and Secure flags.
Verify password policies and multi-factor authentication if accessible via API endpoints.
Sample Code:

python
Copy
Edit
def test_session_cookie(url, login_payload):
    session = requests.Session()
    response = session.post(url, data=login_payload)
    cookies = session.cookies.get_dict()
    cookie_flags = {}
    for cookie in session.cookies:
        cookie_flags[cookie.name] = {
            "HttpOnly": cookie._rest.get("HttpOnly", False),
            "Secure": cookie.secure
        }
    return cookie_flags

# Example usage:
login_url = "https://example.com/login"
payload = {"username": "test", "password": "test123"}
print(test_session_cookie(login_url, payload))
7. File Upload Security Testing
Objective: Check that file uploads validate type, size, and content.
Method:

Write scripts that attempt to upload files with malicious extensions or oversized content.
Verify the server’s response to confirm it blocks unwanted files.
Pseudo‑Code:

python
Copy
Edit
def test_file_upload(url, file_path):
    files = {'file': open(file_path, 'rb')}
    response = requests.post(url, files=files)
    # Check if response indicates rejection or sanitization.
    return response.status_code, response.text

# Example usage:
upload_url = "https://example.com/upload"
print(test_file_upload(upload_url, "malicious.exe"))
8. Security Misconfiguration Testing
Objective: Identify misconfigurations like open ports, verbose error messages, or default credentials.
Method:

Review responses for error messages that reveal internal configurations.
You might write a function to check for common default paths (e.g., /admin, /config) and report if they are accessible.
9. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Testing
Objective: Confirm anti-CSRF tokens are implemented on state-changing requests.
Method:

Attempt to submit a state-changing request without a CSRF token.
Check if the server rejects the request.
Pseudo‑Code:

python
Copy
Edit
def test_csrf(url, payload):
    # Simulate a POST without including the CSRF token.
    response = requests.post(url, data=payload)
    if response.status_code in [403, 401]:
        return "CSRF protection appears effective."
    else:
        return "CSRF protection may be lacking!"

# Example usage:
post_url = "https://example.com/update-profile"
payload = {"name": "Test"}
print(test_csrf(post_url, payload))
10. Clickjacking Protection
Objective: Verify protection against clickjacking.
Method:

Check for X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors headers using the method from section 1.
11. Fuzz Testing
Objective: Send random or unexpected inputs to endpoints to uncover unhandled errors.
Method:

Create a function that generates random strings/numbers and submits them to your endpoints.
Monitor for crashes or unhandled exceptions.
12. Access Control Testing
Objective: Verify that role-based access controls (RBAC) are properly enforced.
Method:

Try accessing restricted endpoints with and without proper authentication.
Check the response codes (e.g., 403 Forbidden when access should be denied).
13. API Security Testing
Objective: Check API endpoints for proper authentication, rate limiting, and input validation.
Method:

Write tests that simulate API calls with both valid and invalid data.
Validate error handling and rate limiting behaviors.
